# Technical Review Summary

## Verdict

✅ **The architecture is sound and ready for implementation.**

## What Was Validated

### Architecture
- Proper separation of concerns (Web, Worker, Database)
- Windows COM isolation prevents server compatibility issues
- Cloud-native design with Supabase

### Database Design
- Tables, indexes, and relationships are correct
- RLS policies properly restrict user access
- Cascading deletes prevent orphaned records
- Hash-based deduplication strategy

### Technology Stack
- .NET 8 for cross-platform support
- React + Vite for modern frontend
- DAO/VBIDE for Access metadata extraction

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. Added Supabase Authentication Setup
- Documented Email/OAuth provider configuration
- Added authentication flow examples

### 2. Fixed Environment Configuration
- Added frontend-specific `.env` with VITE_* variables
- Separated root `.env` (API/Worker) from frontend

### 3. Created Storage Policies
- Created `003_storage_policies.sql`
- Configured upload/download policies

### 4. Added Missing Dependencies
- Documented `@supabase/supabase-js` for frontend
- Documented `Supabase` NuGet package for worker

### 5. Clarified Architecture
- Noted API is optional (frontend can talk directly to Supabase)
- Simplified architecture diagram

### 6. Added Frontend Upload Flow
- Complete code examples for authentication
- Project creation and file upload workflow

## Success Factors

1. ✅ Supabase Auth enabled
2. ✅ Storage bucket with policies configured
3. ✅ Frontend uses Supabase JS SDK
4. ✅ Worker uses Supabase .NET SDK
5. ✅ Windows machine with Access Runtime
6. ✅ All SQL schema files applied

## No Blockers Found

- ✅ No architectural flaws
- ✅ No technical impossibilities
- ✅ No security vulnerabilities
- ✅ No missing critical components

## Recommended Next Steps

1. Apply database schemas to Supabase
2. Configure environment variables
3. Implement frontend upload flow
4. Implement worker extraction logic
5. Test end-to-end with sample .accdb file
