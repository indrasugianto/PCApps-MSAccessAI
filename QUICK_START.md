## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Frontend not loading?

**Check if it's running:**
- Open a NEW terminal window
- Run: 
  ```bash
  cd C:\GitHub\PCApps-MSAccessAI\apps\web
  npm run dev
  ```

### Worker not processing?

**Check if it needs Access Runtime:**

The worker requires Windows and Microsoft Access to extract metadata.

**If you don't have Access:**
1. Download Access Runtime (free): https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=54920
2. Install it
3. Enable VBA Trust (see instructions below)

**Enable VBA Trust:**
1. Open Microsoft Access
2. File → Options
3. Trust Center → Trust Center Settings
4. Macro Settings
5. ✅ Check "Trust access to the VBA project object model"
6. Click OK
7. Restart the worker

**Then restart worker:**
```bash
cd C:\GitHub\PCApps-MSAccessAI\apps\worker
dotnet run
```

## 📊 What to Expect

### When you upload a file:

1. **File uploads** (you'll see progress)
2. **Status shows "Pending"**
3. **Worker picks it up** (within 4 seconds)
4. **Status changes to "Processing"**
5. **Extraction happens** (DAO for queries, VBIDE for VBA)
6. **Status changes to "Completed"**
7. **Results appear!** 🎉

### In the worker console:
```
Access Metadata Extraction Worker
==================================
Supabase URL: https://qexnxhojzciwdzlwttcd.supabase.co

## 🎯 Test Without Worker

**You can test the frontend without the worker!**

- Upload files ✅
- Create projects ✅
- See file status as "Pending" ✅
- Files will be processed when worker is set up

## ✅ Setup Checklist

- [x] Database configured
- [x] Storage bucket created  
- [x] Frontend environment set
- [x] Worker environment set
- [x] Frontend running
- [x] Worker starting
- [ ] Access Runtime installed (if needed)
- [ ] VBA Trust enabled (if needed)
- [ ] Test upload completed

## 💡 Tips

- **Start with a small Access file** for faster testing
- **Check browser console (F12)** if something doesn't work
- **The worker needs Access** to extract VBA - frontend works without it
- **Files are queued** - they'll process when worker is ready

## 🎊 You're Ready!

**Go to: http://localhost:5173**

Start testing! 🚀
