# ✅ Worker Fix Applied!

## 🔧 What Was Fixed

1. **Compilation Error**: Fixed ambiguous `Download()` method call
2. **Database Connection**: URL-encoded the password (`?` → `%3F`)
3. **Windows Platform**: Updated to `net8.0-windows` target
4. **Nullable Warnings**: Added proper null checks

## 🚀 Worker is Ready!

The worker has been fixed and should now run successfully.

### To Test the Worker:

**Open a new PowerShell/Terminal window and run:**

```bash
cd C:\GitHub\PCApps-MSAccessAI\apps\worker
dotnet run
```

You should see:
```
Access Metadata Extraction Worker
==================================
Supabase URL: https://qexnxhojzciwdzlwttcd.supabase.co
Poll Interval: 4000ms

(waiting for jobs...)
```

The worker will poll every 4 seconds for new import jobs.
