# 🎉 You're Ready to Test!

## ✅ Both Services Are Starting!

I've started both the frontend and worker for you:

- **Frontend**: Running at http://localhost:5173
- **Worker**: Running and polling for jobs every 4 seconds

---

## 🧪 Testing Steps

### 1. Open the Application

**Go to:** http://localhost:5173

You should see the login/signup page.

---

### 2. Create an Account

1. Click **"Don't have an account? Sign Up"**
2. Enter:
   - **Email**: your-email@example.com
   - **Password**: (at least 6 characters)
3. Click **"Sign Up"**

> **Note**: If email confirmation is enabled, check your email. Otherwise, you'll be logged in automatically.

---

### 3. Create a Project

1. After login, you'll see the project list (empty at first)
2. Click **"+ New Project"** button
3. Enter:
   - **Project Name**: "Test Project" (or whatever you like)
   - **Description**: (optional)
4. Click **"Create Project"**

---

### 4. Upload an Access File

1. Click on your newly created project
2. You'll see the project view with tabs: Overview, Queries, VBA Modules
3. In the **File Upload** section:
   - Click **"Choose File"**
   - Select a `.accdb` or `.mdb` file from your computer
   - Click **"Upload File"**

---

### 5. Watch the Magic Happen! ✨

**What happens next:**

1. **File uploads** to Supabase Storage
2. **Import job created** with status "pending"
3. **Worker detects** the job (within 4 seconds)
4. **Worker downloads** the file
5. **Worker extracts**:
   - SQL queries using DAO
   - VBA modules using VBIDE
6. **Worker saves** metadata to database
7. **Frontend auto-refreshes** (every 3 seconds)
8. **You see results!** 🎊

---

### 6. View Extracted Metadata

Once processing completes:

- **Queries Tab**: Shows all extracted SQL queries
  - Query name
  - Query type (Select, Update, etc.)
  - SQL text
  - Source file

- **VBA Modules Tab**: Shows all extracted VBA code
  - Module name
  - Module type (Standard, Class, Form)
  - Full VBA code
  - Source file

---

## 🎯 What to Test

### Basic Functionality
- ✅ User signup/login works
- ✅ Create multiple projects
- ✅ Upload multiple Access files to same project
- ✅ View extracted queries
- ✅ View extracted VBA modules
- ✅ Filter by filename (if multiple files)

### Edge Cases
- 📁 Upload file with no queries
- 📁 Upload file with no VBA modules
- 📁 Upload multiple files in succession
- 📁 Upload same file twice (test deduplication)

### Error Handling
- ❌ Upload non-Access file (should show error)
- ❌ Upload corrupted Access file
- ❌ Network interruption during upload

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Frontend Issues

**"Cannot connect to server"**
- Check if frontend is running: http://localhost:5173
- Check browser console (F12) for errors

**"Failed to upload file"**
- Check file size (Supabase free tier has limits)
- Ensure file is .accdb or .mdb format
- Check browser console for errors

**"Not seeing results after upload"**
- Wait a few seconds (worker polls every 4s)
- Check if worker is running
- Refresh the page

### Worker Issues

**Worker not processing files:**
- Check if worker is running
- Look for error messages in worker console
- Verify Access/Access Runtime is installed
- Verify VBA Trust is enabled

**"DAO.DBEngine.120 not found"**
- Install Microsoft Access Database Engine
- Or install Access Runtime (free)

**"VBE object is null"**
- Enable "Trust access to VBA project object model"
- In Access: File → Options → Trust Center → Trust Center Settings → Macro Settings

## 📊 Expected Console Output

### Worker Console Should Show:

```
Access Metadata Extraction Worker
==================================
Supabase URL: https://qexnxhojzciwdzlwttcd.supabase.co
Poll Interval: 4000ms

Found 1 pending job(s)
Processing job abc123...: MyDatabase.accdb
  Downloaded to: C:\Users\...\Temp\abc123_MyDatabase.accdb
  Extracting queries...
  Found 15 queries
  Extracting VBA modules...
  Found 3 modules
✓ Completed job abc123: 15 queries, 3 modules
```

### Frontend Console Should Show:

- No errors (check with F12)
- Successful API calls to Supabase
- Real-time updates as data loads

---

## 🎨 UI Features to Notice

- **Real-time updates**: Data appears without refreshing
- **Multiple files**: Each file shows separately
- **Syntax display**: SQL and VBA shown in readable format
- **File filtering**: Can filter results by source file
- **Metadata**: Query types, module types, timestamps

---

## 📝 Test Checklist

- [ ] Signup/login successful
- [ ] Create project works
- [ ] Upload Access file works
- [ ] Worker processes file
- [ ] Queries appear in Queries tab
- [ ] VBA modules appear in VBA tab
- [ ] Can view full SQL text
- [ ] Can view full VBA code
- [ ] Can upload second file
- [ ] Both files' data shows correctly
- [ ] Logout works
- [ ] Login again shows same projects

---

## 🎉 Success Criteria

You'll know everything works when:

1. ✅ You can upload an Access file
2. ✅ Worker shows processing in console
3. ✅ Queries appear in frontend
4. ✅ VBA modules appear in frontend
5. ✅ You can view the extracted code

---

## 💡 Tips

- **Keep worker console visible** to see processing happen
- **Use browser DevTools (F12)** to debug frontend issues
- **Try small Access file first** for faster testing
- **Upload multiple files** to test multi-file support
- **Check database** in Supabase dashboard to see raw data
